		<h2>Game Concept</h2>
		<p>It is 2021 and all is well in the world. Until someone decided
		to steal Canada’s supply of Maple Syrup! Now the world is on the 
		cusp of extinction – Canada having waged war on the world for 
		taking their syrup. Elon Musk has escaped to his Super Secret 
		Colony on Mars but in his haste has left behind ONE spaceship.
		A group of survivor's race against each other to get to the last 
		available spaceship in order to leave the hell that Earth has 
		become and find a place to live out in the stars.
		Only one player can reach the spaceship.
		Will it be you?
		Many things stand in your way, a fierce landscape blocks your 
		path with obstacles to be avoided, food and supplies to gather 
		for a boost in stamina to reach the end and weapons to sabotage 
		your opponents.
		Not to mention the world is being teared apart, creating random 
		geographical events to block your path and destroy your speed! 
		Survive every level and win your ticket off this earth!</p>

				<p>We began our first meeting by introducing ourselves 
				and discussing our strengths and weaknesses. We found 
				that as a team we all had the skills of at least one of 
				the requirements each to complete this project. Some of 
				us had experience in website design, some were advanced 
				in Unity and games design and some of us were confident 
				in documentation. We then selected our team manager, 
				Jenny, who would be in charge of makings sure we all were
				up to date throughout the year. We then discussed game 
				ideas and concepts and settled on our Maple Syrup pitch.
				After we planned out our video pitch, we finished by splitting 
				the group into four teams: Graphics and Game Design, 
				Implementation Coding, Website Development and Documentation.</p>

				<p>Now that the first submission has passed we discussed 
				how to continue building our game, Dead Sprint. We went 
				over our successes and issues from the first month and 
				reconfigured teams when needed. By now we have designed 
				and created our characters and first level design. The 
				documentation team finished off any final requirements 
				and began merging into the three other groups. We also 
				received a new group member who joined the Website 
				Development. Now that we have all taken time to invest 
				and learn Unity for games design, our next goals are to 
				make a sufficient and reliable game for the next 
				submission date.

				<p>Our second submission has passed so we now needed to 
				reconfigure the team. We spent the previous meeting 
				outlying every aspect of the game that needed to be 
				completed by December and divided it accordingly. Each 
				member took the responsibility of two aspects, one they 
				felt confident on and one they hadn’t previously worked 
				with so they could learn a new skill. As documentation 
				was not as large a part as before, we separated into 
				four groups again, this time with Unit Testing and 
				Security as the fourth. All members of the team have 
				now worked with Unity and GitHub. We outlined a detailed 
				plan to make sure we would be ready for the next 
				submission.</p>

				<p>We started by going through all aspects of the game 
				assigned to each members, assigning help to whoever 
				needed it. Most of the games implementations are complete, 
				our main struggle has been finding a way to connect all 
				elements of the game together but luckily we set up a coding
				forum on our Discord account so everyone could post their code 
				there. With the submission just under two weeks away we are happy 
				with the work that has been done. Except from the final unit testing, 
				a few aspect on the website, some Unity scripts and a few 
				implementations we are good to go.</p>
