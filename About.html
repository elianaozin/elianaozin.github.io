				<h2>Game Concept</h2>
				<p>It is 2021 and all is well in the world.<br>
				Until someone decided to steal Canada’s supply of Maple Syrup! Now the world is on the cusp of extinction 
				– Canada having waged war on the world for taking their syrup. Elon Musk has escaped to his Super Secret 
				Colony on Mars but in his haste has left behind ONE spaceship.<br>
				A group of survivor's race against each other to get to the last available spaceship in order to leave the hell that Earth 
				has become and find a place to live out in the stars.<br>Only one player can reach
				the spaceship.<br> Will it be you?<br> Many things stand in your way, a fierce landscape blocks your path with obstacles 
				to be avoided, food and supplies to gather for a boost in stamina to reach the end and weapons to sabotage your opponents. <br>
				Not to mention the world is being teared apart, creating random geographical events to block your path and destroy your speed! 
				Survive every level and win your ticket off this earth! </p>
