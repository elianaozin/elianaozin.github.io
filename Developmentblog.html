										<center><h1>Our Journey...</h1>
										<h2>12/10/2020</h2>
										<p>
We began our first meeting by introducing ourselves and discussing our strengths and weaknesses. We found that as a team we all had the skills of at least one of the requirements each to complete this project. Some of us had experience in website design, some were advanced in Unity and games design and some of us were confident in documentation. We then selected our team manager, Jenny, who would be in charge of makings sure we all were up to date throughout the year. We then discussed game ideas and concepts and settled on our Maple Syrup pitch. After we planned out our video pitch, we finished by splitting the group into four teams: Graphics and Game Design, Implementation Coding, Website Development and Documentation.</p>
<h2>05/11/2020</h2>
<p>Now that the first submission has passed we discussed how to continue building our game, Dead Sprint. We went over our successes and issues from the first month and reconfigured teams when needed. By now we have designed and created our characters and first level design. The documentation team finished off any final requirements and began merging into the three other groups. We also received a new group member who joined the Website Development. Now that we have all taken time to invest and learn Unity for games design, our next goals are to make a sufficient and reliable game for the next submission date.</p>
<h2>19/11/2020</h2>
<p>Our second submission has passed so we now needed to reconfigure the team. We spent the previous meeting outlying every aspect of the game that needed to be completed by December and divided it accordingly. Each member took the responsibility of two aspects, one they felt confident on and one they hadnâ€™t previously worked with so they could learn a new skill. As documentation was not as large a part as before, we separated into four groups again, this time with Unit Testing and Security as the fourth. All members of the team have now worked with Unity and GitHub. We outlined a detailed plan to make sure we would be ready for the next submission.</p>
<h2>05/12/2020</h2>
<p>We started by going through all aspects of the game assigned to each members, assigning help to whoever needed it. Most of the games implementations are complete, our main struggle has been finding a way to connect all elements of the game together but luckily we set up a coding forum on our Discord account so everyone could post their code there. With the submission just under two weeks away we are happy with the work that has been done. Except from the final unit testing, a few aspect on the website, some Unity scripts and a few implementations we are good to go.</p>
